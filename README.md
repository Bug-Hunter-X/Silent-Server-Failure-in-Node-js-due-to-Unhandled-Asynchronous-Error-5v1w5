# Silent Server Failure in Node.js

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Node.js HTTP server where an asynchronous operation throwing an error before `res.end()` is called leads to a silent failure.  The server doesn't crash, but it also doesn't respond properly to the client.

## Bug Description
The issue stems from a lack of comprehensive error handling within the asynchronous callback function. If an error occurs before the `res.end()` method is called, the response is never properly sent to the client, leading to a silent hang or timeout.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`
3. Send multiple requests to `http://localhost:3000`. You'll notice some requests succeed and some time out or hang without any server-side error messages.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors within the asynchronous callback function and ensuring that `res.end()` or `res.writeHead` along with appropriate error codes are always called, even if an error occurs.
